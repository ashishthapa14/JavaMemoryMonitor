# JVM Memory Monitor

This is a JavaFX application designed to provide real-time monitoring and visualization of Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory usage. It collects various memory statistics, including heap and non-heap memory, garbage collection (GC) details, and memory allocation rates, and presents them through a graphical user interface (GUI) with dynamic charts and labels.

## Features

*   Real-time display of Heap and Non-Heap memory usage.
*   Visualization of memory usage over time using line charts.
*   Snapshot view of current memory usage using bar charts.
*   Monitoring of Garbage Collection (GC) count and time.
*   Estimation and visualization of memory allocation rate.
*   Logging of GC events.

## Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
*   Maven 3.6.0 or higher

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd memory-monitor-tool
```

### 2. Build the Project

Navigate to the project root directory and build the project using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file in the `target/` directory.

### 3. Run the Application

You can run the application directly using the Maven JavaFX plugin:

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```

Alternatively, you can run the generated JAR file. First, ensure you have a JDK with JavaFX runtime components available. If not, you might need to download a JDK that includes JavaFX or configure your environment to use OpenJFX modules.

```bash
java -jar target/memory-monitor-tool-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Usage

Once the application starts, you will see a GUI displaying various JVM memory metrics. The charts will update in real-time. You can use the "Start Monitor" and "Stop Monitor" buttons to control the monitoring process.
